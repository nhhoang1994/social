<p><strong>RACISM EXISTS IN AUSTRALIA</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left">            </p>
<p style="text-align:left">        This acknowledgement is a</p>
<p style="text-align:left">relatively recent feature of our history as a country, as we know that</p>
<p style="text-align:left">colonisation and white settlement paid little respect or acknowledgement that</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were the original and first inhabitants</p>
<p style="text-align:left">of this land. It is worth remembering how breathtakingly audacious that was,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">particular when we know that the First Nations people of this country were here</p>
<p style="text-align:left">just a little bit longer, by tens of thousands of years. Our history as a</p>
<p style="text-align:left">country of predominately white settlers has not been good in this regard. So it</p>
<p style="text-align:left">is true to say that our time since white settlement has quite obviously racist</p>
<p style="text-align:left">overtones. It is also true to say that prior to white settlement, the continent</p>
<p style="text-align:left">that we now call Australia was in fact multicultural, with many different First</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Nations peoples living across the vast expanse of land.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Racism does</p>
<p style="text-align:left">exist in Australia. We know this is a fact. Our own complaints at the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Australian Human Rights Commission tell us that.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">It is also identified</p>
<p style="text-align:left">in research. National data from the Challenging Racism</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Project[1] was released in 2011 and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">gave us information about the prevalence of racism and attitudes about racism.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">We know from this research that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander</p>
<p style="text-align:left">peoples continue to experience high levels of racism, across multiple settings.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">The research found that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander respondents</p>
<p style="text-align:left">returned much higher rates of experiences of racism: in relation to contact with</p>
<p style="text-align:left">police and seeking housing, their experiences of racism were four times that of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">non-Aboriginal Australians.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Similarly, 2008 other research found that 27% of Aboriginal and Torres</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Strait Islander peoples over the age of 15 reported experiencing discrimination</p>
<p style="text-align:left">in the preceding 12 months; in particular by the general public, in law and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">justice settings and in employment.[3] Further recent research has found that three out of four Aboriginal and Torres</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Strait Islander peoples regularly experienced race discrimination when accessing</p>
<p style="text-align:left">primary health care, and that racism and cultural barriers led to some</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples not being diagnosed and treated</p>
<p style="text-align:left">for disease in its early stages, when treatment is most</p>
<p style="text-align:left">effective.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">More generally,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">the Challenging Racism research resulted in the following findings:</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">around 85% of respondents believe that racism is a current issue in</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Australia</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">around 20% of respondents had experienced forms of race-hate talk (verbal</p>
<p style="text-align:left">abuse, name-calling, racial slurs, offensive gestures etc)</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">around 11% of respondents identified as having experienced race-based</p>
<p style="text-align:left">exclusion from their workplaces and/or social activities</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">7% of respondents identified as having experienced unfair treatment based on</p>
<p style="text-align:left">their race</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">6% of respondents reported that they had experienced physical attacks based</p>
<p style="text-align:left">on their race[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">This</p>
<p style="text-align:left">research also found that people born overseas experienced higher rates of racism</p>
<p style="text-align:left">than those born in Australia, and were twice as likely to experience racism in</p>
<p style="text-align:left">the workplace.[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Culturally</p>
<p style="text-align:left">and linguistically diverse communities in Australia are themselves diverse, each</p>
<p style="text-align:left">community and generation having quite different experiences of migration and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">settlement. As a result, their experiences of racism vary considerably, and have</p>
<p style="text-align:left">also varied over time. For example, research suggests that ‘settled’</p>
<p style="text-align:left">immigrants tend to experience lower levels of racism or racist attitudes than</p>
<p style="text-align:left">more recent arrivals to Australia.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The Australian Human Rights Commission’s recent work with</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Arab[8] and Muslim Australians and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">African Australians[9] suggests that</p>
<p style="text-align:left">these communities are at a higher risk of experiencing discrimination and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">prejudice. This supports previous research undertaken by the Commission that</p>
<p style="text-align:left">found “visible" ethnic and religious minorities such as Arabs, Muslims,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Africans, Jews, Palestinians and Turkish people, are groups more likely to be</p>
<p style="text-align:left">regularly subjected to racism. Members of these communities identified that</p>
<p style="text-align:left">their "difference" in terms of skin colour, dress or cultural/religious</p>
<p style="text-align:left">practices singles them out as targets of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">racism.[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">There are also</p>
<p style="text-align:left">particular groups within culturally and linguistically diverse communities which</p>
<p style="text-align:left">appear to particularly experience racism. For example, so-called shock jock</p>
<p style="text-align:left">radio presenter’s frequently veer into racial stereotyping and demeaning</p>
<p style="text-align:left">of asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Similarly, the Commission’s work</p>
<p style="text-align:left">with international students[11] makes clear that these temporary residents are often taken advantage of –</p>
<p style="text-align:left">or discriminated against – by health providers, migration agents,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">employers and real estate agents because of their race or colour or their</p>
<p style="text-align:left">ethnicity, their sex or their age, and sometimes because of a combination of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">these factors.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Alarmingly, some research indicates a significant increase</p>
<p style="text-align:left">in racism over recent years: the Scanlon Foundation’s Mapping Social</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Cohesion 2011[12] report found that</p>
<p style="text-align:left">in 2010 there was a marked increase in reported racial discrimination, and that</p>
<p style="text-align:left">this increased reporting was maintained in the 2011 survey. Disturbingly, this</p>
<p style="text-align:left">research also highlighted the lack of awareness of most Australians about the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">issues faced by our First Nations peoples.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">What is racism?</p>
<p style="text-align:left">So</p>
<p style="text-align:left">the evidence says that racism exists in Australia.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">This should not</p>
<p style="text-align:left">surprise us as racism is to be found in every society on earth in different</p>
<p style="text-align:left">forms.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">I want to talk a little bit about what racism is and how it</p>
<p style="text-align:left">impacts in the Australian context. My concern is that while the data suggests</p>
<p style="text-align:left">that racism does exist, we do not have much of a community dialogue about how</p>
<p style="text-align:left">racism manifests and the harm that it causes.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Without such</p>
<p style="text-align:left">understanding, it is difficult to see how we can move forward to eradicate</p>
<p style="text-align:left">racism.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Racism takes many forms. In general, it is a belief that a</p>
<p style="text-align:left">particular race or ethnicity is inferior or superior to others. Racial</p>
<p style="text-align:left">discrimination involves any act where a person is treated unfairly or vilified</p>
<p style="text-align:left">because of their race, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin, religion or</p>
<p style="text-align:left">belief. Racism impacts directly on the full enjoyment of individual’s</p>
<p style="text-align:left">human rights, and in particular the right to equality.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Racism is</p>
<p style="text-align:left">experienced across a spectrum. It may occur in a passive way by excluding people</p>
<p style="text-align:left">socially or by being indifferent to their views and experiences.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Racism</p>
<p style="text-align:left">may take the form of prejudice and stereotyping of different groups in our</p>
<p style="text-align:left">community; in name calling, taunting or insults; or in actively and directly</p>
<p style="text-align:left">excluding or discriminating against people from services on opportunities on the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">basis of their race, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin, religion or</p>
<p style="text-align:left">belief; for example, in relation to employment opportunities, access to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">education, or participation in sport.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">It can manifest through commentary</p>
<p style="text-align:left">or drawings in the media, speeches at public rallies or assemblies and abuse on</p>
<p style="text-align:left">the internet – including in e-forums, blogs and on social networking</p>
<p style="text-align:left">sites.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Sometimes racism can be reflected in not telling the history of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">an event or the experience of a group of people in our country.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">In its</p>
<p style="text-align:left">most serious manifestation, racism is demonstrated in behaviours and activities</p>
<p style="text-align:left">that embody hate, abuse and violence – particularly experienced by groups</p>
<p style="text-align:left">who are visibly different as a result of their cultural or religious dress,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">their skin colour or their physical appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Just as other forms of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">discrimination may relate to a number of attributes, so will the experience of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">racism. Racism may compound the experience of discrimination of a woman, who is</p>
<p style="text-align:left">treated less favourably on the basis of her race and her gender –</p>
<p style="text-align:left">or an older person, who is discriminated against on the basis of their skin</p>
<p style="text-align:left">colour and their age.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">On occasions, racism can occur more</p>
<p style="text-align:left">systemically, as when people with overseas skills and work experience are</p>
<p style="text-align:left">overlooked for employment,[13] or</p>
<p style="text-align:left">when job applicants without Anglo-Saxon names have difficulty being offered job</p>
<p style="text-align:left">interviews.[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">And it</p>
<p style="text-align:left">often is linked to poverty and social and economic status, as is the experience</p>
<p style="text-align:left">of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples generally.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">A key</p>
<p style="text-align:left">feature of racism in Australia is denialism.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Such denial may be a</p>
<p style="text-align:left">genuine response that suggests a lack of understanding that an act may be</p>
<p style="text-align:left">racist. However, there are also deliberate falsehoods, misinformation or</p>
<p style="text-align:left">evasion. Suggestions of racism may also be dismissed as an overreaction, where</p>
<p style="text-align:left">people think that telling a racist joke, for example, should be taken as just a</p>
<p style="text-align:left">bit of fun. Too often, stories start with “I’m not racist,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">but...”</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Ultimately, racism:is a denial of human relationship. Yet for many people it remains almost</p>
<p style="text-align:left">invisible, unnoticed except when violence is involved. Those who do not</p>
<p style="text-align:left">experience it often fail to understand how profoundly offensive it</p>
<p style="text-align:left">is.[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Racism is bad for</p>
<p style="text-align:left">us</p>
<p style="text-align:left">There is also significant research that demonstrates the damage</p>
<p style="text-align:left">that racism causes to individuals and society as a whole. I don’t intend</p>
<p style="text-align:left">to explore this tonight, as I want to focus on what we can do about it. But some</p>
<p style="text-align:left">of the research is referenced for your further</p>
<p style="text-align:left">information.[16] This research</p>
<p style="text-align:left">clearly demonstrates – among other things – that racism, literally,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">makes you sick.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">More broadly, racism undermines social cohesion within</p>
<p style="text-align:left">the community. To ensure social inclusion, individuals need the opportunity to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">‘secure a job; access services; connect with family, friends, work,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">personal interests and local community; deal with personal crisis; and have</p>
<p style="text-align:left">their voices heard’.[17] Racism towards any individual or community undermines the achievement of each of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">these goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Racism also impacts adversely on the development of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Australia as a multicultural society. If we conceive multiculturalism as a set</p>
<p style="text-align:left">of norms or principles in which the human rights of all are respected, protected</p>
<p style="text-align:left">and promoted, then the adverse impacts on groups in the community who may be</p>
<p style="text-align:left">treated less favourably on the basis of their race, colour, national or ethnic</p>
<p style="text-align:left">origin or religious belief is obvious.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Multiculturalism supports the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">ideals of a democratic society in which every person is free and equal in</p>
<p style="text-align:left">dignity and rights. Racism undermines these very foundations.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The</p>
<p style="text-align:left">existing framework for addressing racism in Australia</p>
<p style="text-align:left">In this country,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">the first national anti-discrimination law to be passed addressed</p>
<p style="text-align:left">racism.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Australia became a signatory to the International Convention on</p>
<p style="text-align:left">the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) in 1966 and then ratified it in</p>
<p style="text-align:left">1975. The ICERD outlines Australia’s obligations to safeguard human</p>
<p style="text-align:left">rights in the political, economic, social, cultural and other fields of public</p>
<p style="text-align:left">life so that human rights are ensured to everyone without racial discrimination.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The Racial Discrimination Act (RDA), was then passed in 1975. It seeks to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">promote equality before the law for all persons and implements the principle of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">prohibiting discrimination against people on the basis of their race, colour, or</p>
<p style="text-align:left">national or ethnic origin.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The RDA has provisions against direct and indirect discrimination. Among</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Australian anti-discrimination laws it has unusually broad coverage. Most</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Australian anti-discrimination laws provide a list of areas of life or</p>
<p style="text-align:left">situations in which discrimination is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The RDA takes a different approach. It makes it unlawful for a person or</p>
<p style="text-align:left">organisation to act in a way that, on the basis of a person’s race,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">colour, national or ethnic origin, nullifies, negates or impairs their</p>
<p style="text-align:left">recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human</p>
<p style="text-align:left">right or fundamental freedom in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">I should note that while this approach is designed to provide a most</p>
<p style="text-align:left">extensive protection it is also a drafting approach which has some complexities</p>
<p style="text-align:left">and potential uncertainties of its own, including in asking domestic Australian</p>
<p style="text-align:left">courts to interpret international law concepts of human rights directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Perhaps for this reason, the broad and general prohibition of discrimination</p>
<p style="text-align:left">in section 9 of the RDA is accompanied by specific prohibitions of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">discrimination in a number of areas of public life:</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">access to places and facilities;</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">land, housing and other accommodation;</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">provision of goods and services;</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">the right to join trade unions; and</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">employment.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">In practice most complaints have been made by reference to these more</p>
<p style="text-align:left">specific provisions. But the general prohibition of racial discrimination</p>
<p style="text-align:left">affecting any human right remains both an important legal safety net and an</p>
<p style="text-align:left">immensely important statement of principle, reflecting the indivisibility of all</p>
<p style="text-align:left">human rights.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The RDA is also distinctive among Australian anti-discrimination and equality</p>
<p style="text-align:left">laws in its general provision for equality before the law, in section 10. Unlike</p>
<p style="text-align:left">most other provisions of the RDA, section 10 is enforced directly through the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">courts rather than through complaints to the Commission. While the number of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">cases brought under section 10 has been small, I think it’s only necessary</p>
<p style="text-align:left">to name one of them – Mabo No 1 – to confirm the importance</p>
<p style="text-align:left">of this provision.[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Without this case’s finding that it was a breach of section 10 of the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">RDA for the Queensland government to seek to confirm that it had retrospectively</p>
<p style="text-align:left">and permanently extinguished any remaining native title over the Torres Strait</p>
<p style="text-align:left">islands, Eddie Mabo and his co-plaintiffs would have lost the right to even</p>
<p style="text-align:left">bring forward the argument that there was such a thing as native title that</p>
<p style="text-align:left">could be recognised under Australian law.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Importantly, the RDA was amended in 1995 to incorporate specific provisions</p>
<p style="text-align:left">that relate to actions which are likely to offend, insult, humiliate or</p>
<p style="text-align:left">intimidate a person or group of people. Mr Lavarch is particularly familiar with</p>
<p style="text-align:left">these provisions, having been the Commonwealth Attorney-General at the time.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">These provisions are important in providing additional protections against, for</p>
<p style="text-align:left">example, race hate.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Supporting ICERD and the RDA in a practical sense,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Australia has had a Commissioner attached to the RDA since 1975, although the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">position has sometimes been filled on a part time basis. In 2011, the position</p>
<p style="text-align:left">of Race Discrimination Commissioner was again filled in a full time capacity.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The role of the Commissioner includes leading the work of the Commission</p>
<p style="text-align:left">in promoting an understanding and acceptance of, and compliance with, the RDA;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">developing and conducting research and educational programs and other programs</p>
<p style="text-align:left">for the purpose of combating racial discrimination; promoting understanding,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">tolerance and friendship among racial and ethnic groups; and supporting the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">purposes and principles of the International</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Convention.[19]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">These three</p>
<p style="text-align:left">elements – ICERD, the RDA and the role of Race Discrimination Commissioner</p>
<p style="text-align:left">– provide a strong structural foundation for tackling racism in Australia</p>
<p style="text-align:left">at a national level.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Current opportunities to strengthen our response</p>
<p style="text-align:left">to racism</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Right now, we are at an interesting juncture.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">There are</p>
<p style="text-align:left">three key initiatives playing out at a national level which address racism</p>
<p style="text-align:left">– the consolidation of Commonwealth Anti-Discrimination Laws, the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">development of a National Anti-Racism Strategy and, of course, the discussion</p>
<p style="text-align:left">about whether or not we need Constitutional reform to recognise Aboriginal and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Torres Strait Islanders in our Constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">There are few occasions in</p>
<p style="text-align:left">a nation’s history where we have the opportunity to simultaneously look at</p>
<p style="text-align:left">the legal foundation document of our country, specific domestic law reform and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">also a nation-wide strategy – all aimed at strengthening our response to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">racism. The possibility of Constitutional reform, legislative reform and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">awareness raising: a powerful trifecta that we need to harness in order to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">continue to promote and support the cultural diversity and social cohesion of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Australia as a country.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">I hope we win the trifecta! But it will need</p>
<p style="text-align:left">concerted action on the part of all Australians.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Let me look briefly at</p>
<p style="text-align:left">these three opportunities in turn.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Constitutional Reform</p>
<p style="text-align:left">It is</p>
<p style="text-align:left">interesting how little most Australians know about our Constitution. This is in</p>
<p style="text-align:left">contrast with countries like South Africa, where every person was given a copy</p>
<p style="text-align:left">of the Constitution when it was adopted in 1996.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">In late 2010 the Prime</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Minister established an Expert Panel to look at possible Constitutional reform</p>
<p style="text-align:left">to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people formally in the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">constitution. The report and recommendations arising from the Expert</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Panel’s extensive consultative process was handed to the Prime Minister on</p>
<p style="text-align:left">19 January this year.[20] The</p>
<p style="text-align:left">question of when a referendum will be held on this important issue is yet to be</p>
<p style="text-align:left">determined by the Government.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The Panel has made a number of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">recommendations that seek to address the embedded racism in our country’s</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Constitution. This racism was not addressed at the time of the 1967 referendum</p>
<p style="text-align:left">that changed our Constitution to give the federal parliament the power to make</p>
<p style="text-align:left">laws in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and to allow</p>
<p style="text-align:left">for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be included in the census.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Nor can it been addressed through the passage of domestic laws.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The Panel’s report reminds us that two sections of the Constitution</p>
<p style="text-align:left">still enable the Commonwealth Government to make laws that discriminate on the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">basis of race: section 25 and the ‘race power’ in section 51 (xxvi).</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Section 25 allows State laws to disqualify people of a particular race from</p>
<p style="text-align:left">voting at State elections. Such a provision has no place in a modern democracy</p>
<p style="text-align:left">like Australia.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Section 51 (xxvi) allows the Commonwealth Parliament to make special laws for</p>
<p style="text-align:left">people of a particular race. There are examples where this has been relied upon</p>
<p style="text-align:left">in order to introduce laws that negatively discriminate against Aboriginal and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Torres Strait Islander peoples.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The Expert Panel has recommended that these two provisions be repealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The Panel has recommended that a new section 51A be inserted in the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Constitution that explicitly respects and acknowledges Aboriginal and Torres</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Strait Islander peoples and promotes the advancement of those peoples.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The Expert Panel has also recommended the insertion of a new section 116A,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">prohibiting the Commonwealth, and States and Territories, from making laws that</p>
<p style="text-align:left">discriminate on the basis of race, colour or ethnic or national origin, but</p>
<p style="text-align:left">permitting laws or measures which aim to overcome disadvantage, ameliorate the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">effects of past discrimination, or protect the cultures, languages or heritage</p>
<p style="text-align:left">of any group.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">A further new section 127A proposes the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Strait Islander languages as the ‘original Australian languages’,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">whilst acknowledging that English is the national language of Australia.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">My Commission has supported these</p>
<p style="text-align:left">recommendations.[21] Obviously, we</p>
<p style="text-align:left">have a long way to go before we come to a referendum on these issues. But it is</p>
<p style="text-align:left">incumbent on us all to think about these issues, to know what they really mean,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">to raise them in our dinner party discussions, in our sporting activities, at</p>
<p style="text-align:left">our work, to dispel the myths that will inevitably fly around in the media and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">be promoted by people who do not understand or accept how important it is to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">ensure racial equality and recognition of our First Nations</p>
<p style="text-align:left">peoples.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Consolidation of Commonwealth Anti-Discrimination Laws</p>
<p style="text-align:left">The project to consolidate Australia’s anti-discrimination laws</p>
<p style="text-align:left">into a single Act was announced by Australian Government in April 2010 as a key</p>
<p style="text-align:left">component of Australia’s Human Rights</p>
<p style="text-align:left">framework.[22]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The Commission</p>
<p style="text-align:left">has welcomed this project, as we consider that discrimination law can be made</p>
<p style="text-align:left">easier to understand, comply with, and where necessary to enforce, through</p>
<p style="text-align:left">greater simplicity and more consistency – both across grounds of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">discrimination and between Commonwealth discrimination law, industrial law, and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">State and Territory anti-discrimination and equal opportunity</p>
<p style="text-align:left">laws.[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">We have also</p>
<p style="text-align:left">welcomed the commitment by the Government that there should be no reduction in</p>
<p style="text-align:left">the level of protection currently</p>
<p style="text-align:left">provided.[24] This commitment is an</p>
<p style="text-align:left">essential benchmark against which draft legislation should be measured during</p>
<p style="text-align:left">its development and against which it will be measured when it becomes</p>
<p style="text-align:left">available.[25]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">It is our</p>
<p style="text-align:left">view that beneficial and best practice features of legislation currently</p>
<p style="text-align:left">applicable to one ground of discrimination be maintained and as far as possible</p>
<p style="text-align:left">applied to all covered grounds of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">discrimination.[26] Some of the key</p>
<p style="text-align:left">features of the RDA have therefore been recommended as model provisions for new</p>
<p style="text-align:left">draft legislation. For example, one of the strengths of the RDA – its</p>
<p style="text-align:left">broad human rights based approach to the areas of public life it covers in</p>
<p style="text-align:left">section 9 – has been recommended as a preferred approach for a general</p>
<p style="text-align:left">human rights or equality based test, in any area of public life, in the new</p>
<p style="text-align:left">draft legislation – rather than placing sole reliance on the more specific</p>
<p style="text-align:left">regimes in the Sex Discrimination, Disability Discrimination and Age</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Discrimination Acts.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Similarly, the Commission has recommended the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">inclusion of an equivalent to RDA section 10 within a consolidated Commonwealth</p>
<p style="text-align:left">equality law: a general equality before the law provision applying to all</p>
<p style="text-align:left">protected attributes under Commonwealth discrimination law.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The</p>
<p style="text-align:left">consolidation process offers an opportunity to not only embrace the stronger</p>
<p style="text-align:left">features of the RDA, but also address some of its deficiencies. If we were to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">ask what would improve the current legislative regime, there are two key</p>
<p style="text-align:left">responses: reviewing who can act and how people or organisations can act to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">enhance racial equality under the Act – and enhancing the current</p>
<p style="text-align:left">compliance framework.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">To take the first issue: all Commonwealth</p>
<p style="text-align:left">discrimination laws include capacity for complaints by or on behalf of persons</p>
<p style="text-align:left">aggrieved by discrimination, leading to investigation and dispute resolution</p>
<p style="text-align:left">functions for the Commission.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The Commission views complaints as an</p>
<p style="text-align:left">important part of a compliance framework directed to achieving the objectives of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">the legislation, in addition to providing a means of access to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The Commission considers that the consolidation process offers</p>
<p style="text-align:left">opportunities to consider measures for improved access to justice for people and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">organisations seeking to assert rights, and for increased certainty for people</p>
<p style="text-align:left">and organisations seeking to comply with their</p>
<p style="text-align:left">responsibilities.[27]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">One</p>
<p style="text-align:left">set of issues about access to justice is presented by the fact that capacity to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">take action at the Federal Court or Federal Magistrates Court stage is more</p>
<p style="text-align:left">restricted than at the Commission stage. A complaint to the Commission can be</p>
<p style="text-align:left">made by any person or organisation on behalf of a person aggrieved by</p>
<p style="text-align:left">discrimination – and the Commission itself has power to launch its own</p>
<p style="text-align:left">inquiries into human rights and discrimination issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">But at the court</p>
<p style="text-align:left">stage, complaints can only be made by a person or persons aggrieved – not</p>
<p style="text-align:left">by representative or advocacy organisations in their own right or by the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Commission or other bodies seeking to enforce the law.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">There are of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">course issues to consider about how and how far a body which provides an</p>
<p style="text-align:left">impartial complaint handling service could have an advocacy role, and we look</p>
<p style="text-align:left">forward to further discussion of those issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">In terms of compliance</p>
<p style="text-align:left">provisions – there are a range of mechanisms provided (although not</p>
<p style="text-align:left">consistently across grounds) in the RDA, SDA, DDA, ADA and AHRCA for achievement</p>
<p style="text-align:left">of their objects. The present review of these Acts provides an opportunity for</p>
<p style="text-align:left">consideration of possible improvements in the compliance framework for</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Commonwealth discrimination law to ensure that it meets, or better meets, the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">goals of efficiency and effectiveness in promoting the objectives of the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">I want to emphasise that even the best anti-discrimination</p>
<p style="text-align:left">law will in itself only be part of an effective and comprehensive strategy to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">eliminate racial discrimination and promote equality. Parties to the ICERD</p>
<p style="text-align:left">undertake a much wider range of obligations than simply enacting legislative</p>
<p style="text-align:left">prohibitions against racial</p>
<p style="text-align:left">discrimination.[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">I will</p>
<p style="text-align:left">discuss the development of a new and comprehensive Anti-Racism Strategy for</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Australia in a moment.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Before moving on from the consolidation process,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">though, I want to refer very briefly to the race hate provisions in the RDA.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">These were not canvassed in the Attorney General’s Department discussion</p>
<p style="text-align:left">paper, and therefore the Commission has not referred to these provisions in its</p>
<p style="text-align:left">submission. The Commission is looking to see what comes out of the submissions</p>
<p style="text-align:left">and further steps in the process in relation to these provisions.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">These</p>
<p style="text-align:left">provisions have recently been tested of course in the Bolt</p>
<p style="text-align:left">case.[29] For any of you who have</p>
<p style="text-align:left">somehow missed this case – perhaps by spending the last year without</p>
<p style="text-align:left">access to newspapers, the internet or any other form of communication –</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Justice Bromberg provides an admirably concise summary of his findings of fact</p>
<p style="text-align:left">and of law at the beginning of his statement of reasons for judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Justice Bromberg found that the imputations conveyed by articles written</p>
<p style="text-align:left">by Mr Bolt and published by the Herald and Weekly Times included that:</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">There are fair-skinned people in Australia with essentially European</p>
<p style="text-align:left">ancestry but with some Aboriginal descent, of which the individuals identified</p>
<p style="text-align:left">in the articles are examples, who are not genuinely Aboriginal persons but who,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">motivated by career opportunities available to Aboriginal people or by political</p>
<p style="text-align:left">activism, have chosen to falsely identify as</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Aboriginal.[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Justice Bromberg said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">I am satisfied that fair-skinned Aboriginal people (or some of them) were</p>
<p style="text-align:left">reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to have been offended, insulted,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">humiliated or intimidated by the imputations conveyed by the newspaper</p>
<p style="text-align:left">articles.[31]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Justice</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Bromberg further found that:</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">I have concluded that the conduct of Mr Bolt and the Herald & Weekly</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Times is not exempted by section 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act from being</p>
<p style="text-align:left">unlawful because:</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">(i) it was not done reasonably and in good faith in the making or</p>
<p style="text-align:left">publishing of a fair comment, within the requirements of section 18D(c)(ii) of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">the Racial Discrimination Act; or</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">(ii) done reasonably and in good faith in the course of any statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">publication or discussion, made or held for a genuine purpose in the public</p>
<p style="text-align:left">interest, within the requirements of section 18D(b) of the Racial Discrimination</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Act.[32]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">There will no</p>
<p style="text-align:left">doubt be continuing debate about these provisions. The issue of balancing the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">right to equality on the basis of race and the right to freedom of expression</p>
<p style="text-align:left">will often incite dramatic commentary of one sort or another. The balance is</p>
<p style="text-align:left">important. At times, one is tempted to ask – how would you feel??? I can</p>
<p style="text-align:left">tell you that if someone said to me – you are only pretending to be part</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Hungarian so you could get the job as Race Discrimination Commissioner, I might</p>
<p style="text-align:left">find that offensive!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The development of a National Anti-Racism</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Strategy</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Finally, I want to talk about a key initiative that I have</p>
<p style="text-align:left">direct responsibility for: the development of a National Anti-Racism Strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">This is very much linked to multiculturalism. The need for a strategy</p>
<p style="text-align:left">had been clearly articulated by the Australian Multicultural Advisory Council to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">the Government in April 2010.[33] This advice was taken up in February 2011, when the establishment of a national</p>
<p style="text-align:left">partnership to develop and implement a National Anti-Racism Strategy for</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Australia was announced as a key component of Australia’s new</p>
<p style="text-align:left">multicultural policy, The People of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Australia.[34]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Government’s intention is that the National Anti-Racism Partnership will</p>
<p style="text-align:left">draw on the existing expertise on anti-racism and multicultural matters across</p>
<p style="text-align:left">three government departments – the Department of Immigration and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Citizenship, the Attorney-General’s Department and the Department of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs – together</p>
<p style="text-align:left">with the Australian Multicultural Council and the Australian Human Rights</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Commission. The National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples and the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Councils of Australia (FECCA) also</p>
<p style="text-align:left">participate in the Partnership as non-government representatives.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">This</p>
<p style="text-align:left">membership of the Partnership makes clear that while the National Anti-Racism</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Strategy was born in the multicultural context, we are looking at its</p>
<p style="text-align:left">development through a broader focus – encapsulating both the experience of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and our culturally,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">linguistically and religiously diverse communities.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The Partnership has</p>
<p style="text-align:left">been tasked with designing, developing and implementing the Strategy, with five</p>
<p style="text-align:left">key areas of effort:</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">• research and consultation;</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">• education resources;</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">• public awareness;</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">• youth</p>
<p style="text-align:left">engagement;</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">• ongoing evaluation.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">It is anticipated that the</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Strategy will be drafted by 30 June 2012 and implemented over three years,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">2012-2015.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The aim of the National Anti-Racism Partnership and Strategy</p>
<p style="text-align:left">is to promote a clear understanding in the Australian community of what racism</p>
<p style="text-align:left">is, and how it can be prevented and reduced.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">We are looking at three</p>
<p style="text-align:left">broad objectives – to create awareness of racism and its impact, to build</p>
<p style="text-align:left">on good practice to prevent it and reduce it and to build capacity for people to</p>
<p style="text-align:left">address it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Over the coming month we will release a discussion paper, run</p>
<p style="text-align:left">an online survey to try and gauge people’s reaction to what will work with</p>
<p style="text-align:left">a campaign and also define an overarching concept. We want business, sport,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">corporate Australia, academia, school kids, community sector organisations,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">political and community leaders – all to sign up to work towards ensuring</p>
<p style="text-align:left">that racism does not impact on the day to day life of Australians.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">If I</p>
<p style="text-align:left">return to my earlier description of racism, it amounts to a denial of human</p>
<p style="text-align:left">relationship. The implication of this is that racism is a matter for all of us</p>
<p style="text-align:left">– not just those who are targeted or suffer directly from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">A</p>
<p style="text-align:left">National Anti-Racism Strategy is about making Australia a racism free zone and</p>
<p style="text-align:left">articulating what role each of us have in achieving this. So it requires all of</p>
<p style="text-align:left">us to play a part – by not perpetrating racist actions ourselves, by not</p>
<p style="text-align:left">passively standing by while others perpetrate such actions and by committing</p>
<p style="text-align:left">ourselves to the notion that the ‘fair go’ is for everyone in our</p>
<p style="text-align:left">society and not restricted according to race, national or ethnic or religious</p>
<p style="text-align:left">background or some historical precedent.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Conclusion</p>
<p style="text-align:left">There</p>
<p style="text-align:left">are many initiatives that already exist at local, state and federal level that</p>
<p style="text-align:left">work towards building a cohesive and safe community in Australia. My role as</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Commonwealth Race Discrimination Commissioner provides an opportunity to focus</p>
<p style="text-align:left">on some of those initiatives.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">As I have said, I do think this is a unique</p>
<p style="text-align:left">opportunity at the moment to get our settings as a country right –</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Constitutional reform, legislative reform and a national campaign to address</p>
<p style="text-align:left">racism. This complements our policy as a multicultural country, and other</p>
<p style="text-align:left">initiatives in play.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">But there is a challenge in this for all of us. We</p>
<p style="text-align:left">share a common humanity, and we all have a role in respecting the right of all</p>
<p style="text-align:left">to enjoy it equally, with dignity and with the same opportunities to thrive.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">I hope tonight I have enthused you to join with me in that</p>
<p style="text-align:left">challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
